Little Red Cap,Altbier,Grimm Brothers Brewhouse,Grimm Brothers Brewhouse Little Red Cap,"Notes:Altbier is German for “Old Beer”, this refers to the “old” style of brewing using an ale yeast (As opposed to a lager yeast fermentation which is a relatively new process). This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an “American Twist” while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF. It also won a Silver Award at the 2016 World beer cup.",5.2,25,50,27,39,18,47,52,28,4,24,59,6,100,3.833333,3.833333,3.833333,3.666667,4.0,3,Loveland,USA

Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.20 IBU\t",13.2,40,60,10,72,69,28,123,23,0,49,23,24,141,4.38756,4.119617,4.334928,4.437799,4.19378,209,Anchorage,USA

Double Ice Bock,Bock - Eisbock,Southampton Publick House,Southampton Publick House Double Ice Bock,"Notes:Southampton Double Ice Bock is based off of a traditional German-style Bock beer. This German lager beer is rich and malty and brewed to an alcohol strength of 6-7%. “Ice Bock” is produced when a Bock beer is partially frozen in order to increase it’s alcohol content. In this process, some of the water content turns to ice, effectively strengthening the flavor and alcohol of the beer. We take this process one step further. After the initial freezing, the beer is decanted off the ice and frozen a second time. The resulting beer is a deceptively smooth and amazingly strong lager.\t",18.0,25,35,15,59,79,15,171,49,0,77,13,10,119,4.022727,3.954545,4.204545,4.181818,4.136364,22,Southampton,USA

Brinkley's Maibock,Bock - Maibock,Free State Brewing Co.,Free State Brewing Co. Brinkley's Maibock,"Notes:This beer has a very full and complex flavor that is best enjoyed slowly, allowing the different flavors time to develop on your tongue. You will find that it changes as you progress from the first taste to the lingering finish. The malty sweetness is well balanced and blended with hop bitterness, giving a full, rich blend of flavors. A generous quantity of pilsner malt is joined with a little bit of caravienne for color and some carapils for body, along with plenty of Munich malt for flavor and aroma. This beer is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle and German Hallertau.The traditional symbol for bock beers of all varieties is the billy goat. This is the reason that Free State named this Maibock after Dr. John R. Brinkley, a.k.a. ""The Goat Gland Doctor."" In 1920s Kansas, Brinkley gained notoriety for his alleged cure for infertility that involved the surgical implantation of goat glands in the affected individuals. Some farmers are even said to have brought along there own goats because they felt them to have superior sexual prowess.\t",6.5,20,38,9,37,11,41,46,18,1,17,64,5,87,3.25,3.666667,3.583333,3.666667,3.416667,6,Lawrence,USA
Heller Bock Saphir,Bock - Maibock,Brauerei Hofstetten Krammer GmbH & Co. KG,Brauerei Hofstetten Krammer GmbH & Co.

This means we stuffed as many full-cone hops – fresh from the fields – as we could into a lager tank and filled the rest of the space with our bock beer. The beer was then left to mature for two months before it was once again enriched with hop oils.To preserve all the wonderful flavors developed during the process, this beer goes directly into bottles without filtration.Light-golden in color with a mild cloudiness, our Saphir-Bock shimmers tantalizingly in the glass. The floral hop aromas harmonize perfectly with the warm ester notes. When taken to the nose, you may make out hints of mandarin, lychee, and ripe pears. On the tongue, you'll immediately be struck by the full-bodiedness. As it moves back across the palate, the hop notes open up, revealing themselves in all their glory in the finish. The pleasant fruity-bitterness travels up the throat, across the palate, and into the nose, where it is greeted, once again, by the sweet ester notes of the yeast.This constant play between full-bodied maltiness and floral hoppiness ensures an unforgettable drinking experience.\t",7.4,20,38,42,68,18,95,75,67,2,78,152,15,98,3.925926,3.87037,4.037037,4.092593,4.092593,27,4113 St. Martin im Mühlkreis,Austria

Brown Ale,Brown Ale - American,Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Brown Ale,"Notes:This is the award-winning original American brown ale, first brewed as a holiday specialty, and now one of our most popular beers year-round.

Brooklyn Brown Ale combines the best of those classic styles and then adds an American accent in the form of a firm hop character and roasty palate. A blend of six malts, some of them roasted, give this beer its deep russet-brown color and complex malt flavor, fruity, smooth and rich, with a caramel, chocolate and coffee background.

Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,Dubbel,Brouwerij Westmalle,Brouwerij Westmalle Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,"Notes:Westmalle Dubbel (7%) is a dark red-brown beer with a rich, complex taste thanks to re-fermentation in the bottle. You pick up touches of caramel, malt and fruity esters reminiscent of ripe banana. The beer pearls beneath a covering of dense, cream-coloured froth. A lovely lace pattern forms on the inside of the glass once emptied. The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles. The beer matures in a different way in a larger bottle to produce a noticeably milder finish.\t",7.0,15,30,24,47,39,23,113,49,0,89,33,31,92,4.076998,4.181774,4.058967,4.146199,4.14425,1026,Westmalle,Belgium

The wild yeasts inhabiting the brewery give all the beers made there a common thread, creating a family of beverages with rare harmony, despite their diverse styles.Decidedly refreshing despite the 7.5% abv, this style of beer was originally brewed in the slow winter season as payment for farmhands in the summer. We certainly don’t mind sitting down after a long day of work and breathing deep the symphony aromas wafting from the lofty, lacey head burgeoning from our tulip glass. Subtle notes of peaches, apricots, canned pineapple, bitters, and a faint herbaceousness belie the smooth and delicate taste. The slightly malty, fruity body quickly transitions effortlessly to a crisp, dry and somewhat tart finish. Signature hints of French oak and the complex yeast character place this all-natural beer among the best saisons, stock ales, and farmhouse styles of Michigan, France & Belgium.\t",7.5,20,30,30,39,13,15,80,204,1,133,23,25,19,4.109091,4.009091,4.045455,4.109091,4.163636,55,Leland Township,USA

Surely therefore, our Saison Dupont is considered as “the classic” among the Belgian season beers!Coppery blond, the finest aromas and a strong bitterness transform this beer into a thirst-quenchener with no equal, just the way it was created. Our selection of yeasts is the perfect base for these typical aromas and ditto taste.

Upon setting out to create the first summer addition to the Stateside line up of ales; the feeling that almost instantly came to me was that of beauty & cleansing. Many summer offerings tend to lack the complexity of their bigger, colder season counterparts; so my goal was to craft an ale of extreme balance with a delicate complexity that allows for contemplation while also providing quaffable refreshment. Starting with a base of German wheat & pale malts this crisp slightly hazy foundation was then accented with a blend of Sterling & Citra hops providing a intricate blend of herbal grass & tangerine citrus flavors and aroma. To pull this all together and to complete the ’cleansing’ aspect of my vision I gently finished the ale off with a touch of white sage, lending a mild earthy spice character to the blend. Of course let’s not forget our house saison yeast that brought all the elements together leaving a dry yet intricate finish.\t",6.6,20,38,38,37,4,31,47,76,0,80,115,20,42,4.141975,4.098765,3.981481,4.148148,4.104938,162,Baltimore,USA

For every case of Shugga’ brewed, we’d short 3 cases of our favorite daily beers. It’s a drag. This year, we brewed something that we think is also cool and brews more like our daily brews. The new brewhouse will help insure this kind of failure never happens again. It’s a mess that we can not brew our BrownShugga’ this year and we suck for not doing it. There is nothing cool about screwing this up this badly and we know it. Maybe we can sue our own sorry selves.

So drinkable, it's scary. Sometimes I wish I could crawl right into the can.Freshness and control have always been my main concern when it comes to our beer. We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the can? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful hop experience. The act of pouring it in a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have work so hard to retain.If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom -- leave them in the can while pouring. This beer is perishable, and at its best when it is young, fresh and hazy. Keep it cold, but not ice cold.

Firestone Lager,Lager - Helles,Firestone Walker Brewing Co.,Firestone Walker Brewing Co. Firestone Lager,"Notes:We created our first Firestone Lager in 2000, and it proved to be well ahead of its time. Now it's back, new and improved, for those who finally want a better lager.In a craft world dominated by hoppy beers, we have gone back to basics with Firestone Lager. this is our hardest beer to make--and our easiest one to drink. Made in the classic all-malt Munich Helles style, Firestone Lager demands technical perfection from our brewing team, with a transparent canvas that would otherwise reveal the smallest flaw. Gambrinus pilsner malt establishes a crisp, dry base with a soft mouthfeel, while noble German hops provide just a whisper of bitterness. The result is an impossibly smooth and immensely drinkable beer that aims to help redefine American Lager. In the words of Brewmaster Matt Brynildson, ""Firestone Lager is made for drinking, not thinking. It's all about enjoying a good, clean beer.""\t",4.5,18,25,46,29,2,45,32,7,3,12,65,4,66,3.211538,3.307692,3.576923,3.403846,3.653846,26,Paso Robles,USA

It is an unfiltered, naturally cloudy beer with a low carbon dioxide content, and it contains all of the natural sediment. As a result, Kellerbier is rich in valuable nutrients such as yeast, protein, minerals and vitamins.Following the old family tradition, Zeppelin beer is brewed in accordance with the German Purity Law of 1516. As with all of our beers, we use the world-famous Tettnanger aromatic hops, high-quality barley grown in upper Swabia and pure water from the uplands of the Alps. We give the dark amber Zeppelin beer seven weeks to quietly mature. The result is a fully flavoured, mildly malty Kellerbier of the highest quality and goodness with an alcohol content of 5.2 percent. It’s a beer which is almost unrivaled in taste, thanks to its extremely delicately spiced, original flavor.\t",5.2,20,40,13,52,18,36,71,21,0,32,52,9,117,3.368421,3.736842,3.763158,3.526316,3.684211,19,Ravensburg,Germany

Rosé De Gambrinus,Lambic - Fruit,Brasserie Cantillon,Brasserie Cantillon Cantillon Rosé De Gambrinus,"Notes:""It has the colour of onion skin"", said a voice behind me. It was Raymond Coumans. He was admiring the colour of the raspberry lambic reflecting in the red copper of the buckets used to empty the barrels. At that time (1986), ""Raspberry-Lambic"" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a rosé, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.The process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Rosé de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.\t",5.0,15,21,29,37,3,6,118,117,0,104,17,3,14,4.155694,4.109431,4.090747,4.170819,4.009786,562,Anderlecht,Belgium

Kriek,Lambic - Fruit,Brouwerij Lindemans,Brouwerij Lindemans Lindemans Kriek,"Notes:Also known as Kriek FoudroyanteWe've already told you that our family never does anything the way other people do. Kriek Lindemans is a good example of that. In order to obtain a beer like no other, we have been adding whole sour cherries to our lambic for generations. Our meeting with American importer Charles Finkel in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuvée René, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world. Nowadays, it is undoubtedly the reference kriek for consumers.18 IBU\t",3.5,15,21,22,28,10,3,87,89,0,102,7,9,13,3.920382,4.031847,3.847134,3.915074,3.83758,471,1602 Sint-Pieters-Leeuw,Belgium

Gueuze,Lambic - Gueuze,Brouwerij Lindemans,Brouwerij Lindemans Lindemans Gueuze,"Notes:From the brewery:There are several stories to explain the origin of the term 'gueuze'. This name dates back to the Rue de Gueuze in Brussels where, for the first time, a producer offered his delicious lambic in champagne bottles. Word about the 'lambick on Rue de Gueuze' quickly got around. According to other sources, gueuze has its roots in 'gazeux' - the French word for carbonated - since traditional gueuze is a carbonated blend of different lambics.After the Second World War, some lambic brewers devised a new production method. They filtered the beer, added sugar, saturated it (with carbon dioxide) and pasteurised it. This new gueuze, closed with a bottle cap and available in 25 cl bottles, was called capped gueuze. Developed according to this production method, Gueuze Lindemans is a slightly sweeter version of Old Gueuze Cuvée René.\t",5.0,0,10,31,32,7,8,131,183,0,97,24,3,24,3.640805,3.747126,3.635057,3.617816,3.649425,174,1602 Sint-Pieters-Leeuw,Belgium

Iris,Lambic - Traditional,Brasserie Cantillon,Brasserie Cantillon Cantillon Iris,"Notes:It is a completely original beer which, contrary to the other products of the Brewery, is not brewed with 35% of wheat. The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities. After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called ""cold hopping"", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.Iris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor. Although it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer.\t",6.5,0,10,69,34,16,90,59,191,4,123,100,17,56,4.197832,4.039295,4.123306,4.226287,4.093496,369,Anderlecht,Belgium

This unique, beautiful brew is often imitated but never matched and is sold literally all over the world. With countless awards to its credit, it is something of which every Briton can be very proud and is the epitome of the greatest of British brewing tradition.In the early years of the modern brewing era, about two hundred years ago, many brewers produced a dark, strong ‘stock’ beer in the winter months, to provide a base amount of fermented beer to add to beers brewed in the rather more volatile months of the summer.Old Peculier probably owes its origins to this. The name pays tribute to the unique ecclesiastical status of Masham as a ‘Court of the Peculier’ and is also reference to the strong characteristic of the beer! For many years it was affectionately referred to as Yorkshire’s ‘Lunatic’s Broth’.\t",5.6,30,65,10,36,22,40,88,32,2,61,38,9,97,3.845304,3.934622,3.837017,3.984346,4.005525,543,Ripon HG4 4YD,United Kingdom

Pils,Pilsner - Bohemian / Czech,Heater Allen Brewing,Heater Allen Brewing Pils,"Notes:Formerly known as ""Pale Lager Beer""This is our take on the renowned Bohemian-style pale lager that you might find in Bavaria or the Czech Republic. When coming up with the recipe for Pils owner/brewmaster, Rick, brewed 17 batches of this beer to make it perfect. The recipe is based on the traditional and beloved Pilsner Urquell, which is why we have chosen not to filter our beer and why our lagering time is as long as it is--from brewday to when we can or keg Pils it is at least eight weeks. Our Pilsner is a little more golden, rounder, and a little more malt driven than many other versions. The beer possesses strong hop character that is balanced by its rich, round, malty palate.

Pilsner,Pilsner - German,Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Pilsner,"Notes:Brooklyn Pilsner is a refreshing golden lager beer, brewed in the style favored by New York’s pre-prohibition brewers. In the 1840’s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the world’s most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. German-grown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.\t",5.1,25,40,35,29,7,54,13,8,8,9,72,2,49,3.582108,3.724265,3.693627,3.723039,3.898284,408,Brooklyn,USA

Three Philosophers - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Quadrupel (Quad),Brewery Ommegang,Brewery Ommegang Bourbon Barrel Aged Three Philosophers,"Notes:We have a new twist on an old favorite coming out in February. Our unique Three Philosophers Quardupel Ale is universally-known as the preferred elixir of life’s meditators, thinkers and theorizers. Now, thanks to Brewmaster Phil Leinhart and the 24 bourbon barrels he got his hands on, mullers of life’s mysteries can ponder all the more deeply. “We’ve experimented with barrel aging in the past and had great success,” said Brewmaster Phil Leinhart. “Three Philosophers is such a lovely, complex beer and it ages so beautifully that we thought it the perfect fit for pairing with bourbon barrels. The result is exactly what we hoped for: even more complex flavors and a slightly fuller body than the standard. We’re sure this’ll be a crowd pleaser.”Like the original, Bourbon Barrel-aged Three Philosophers pours a deep burgundy hue with a fluffy, off-white head. Patience through the aging process rewarded the brewers with flavors of caramel, raisin, dried fruit, molasses, and vanilla and aromas of oak, vanilla, and subtle hints of cherry. The body is ample but still finishes faintly dry with lingering hints of malt, bourbon, and cherry. The effects of barrel-aging, eliciting remnant alcohol from the cooperage during the aging process, escalated the ABV of the beer from 9.7% to a significant, yet sneakily subtle, 11.4% ABV.ABV varies by batch\t",12.3,25,50,17,53,80,16,106,41,0,104,11,35,123,3.333333,4.0,3.333333,3.166667,3.333333,3,Cooperstown,USA

Five different malts, select hop varieties, and our own specially cultivated yeast create an ale which leads with hop flavors and a subtle impression of fruit (our yeast's contribution), followed by a palate pleasing malty finish. Our own special process uses the yeast to naturally carbonate the beer, and we leave it unfiltered. The result is a satisfying brew full of flavor with a remarkably clean and smooth finish.\t",5.0,25,45,7,34,4,36,33,30,0,32,46,0,56,3.302817,3.514085,3.528169,3.556338,3.683099,71,Burlington,USA

It nevertheless boasts the typical sweet and sour balance between a solid malty, toffee-like, chocolaty, roasted and fruity backbone.

After the main fermentation and the second lagering the ""Vichtenaar"" undergoes a third fermentation in oak casks for several months. The oak casks are large vats with a capacity ranging between 5000 and 25000 liters. The ""Vichtenaar"" is a traditional and typical beer for West Flanders, in the Northwest of Belgium. The taste of the ""Vichtenaar"" can be described as slightly acidic and complex and this through the long fermentation in oak casks. The fresh taste of the ""Vichtenaar"" makes it a particularly thirst-quenching beer, especially during the summer months. The ""Vichtenaar"" is also one of the last old-Flemish red-brown beers which are matured in oak casks and is especially appreciated for its authenticity by the beer connoisseur.

The fruit is sourced from the region around Sint-Truiden in Limburg (Belgium).Unlike the most famous fruit beers the basic beer of the ""real cherry beer"" is not a Lambic but a West-Flemish red-brown ale aged in oak wood. About mid-July at the picking, the Northern cherries are brought in at the brewery and laid in on the base beer.Because the taste of the cherry fruit varies from year to year and this according to the number of hours of sunshine or rain, the kriekenbier at its final composition is blended with cherry beer from the year before and two-year old cherry beer.

La Luna Rossa,Sour - Flanders Red Ale,Birrificio Del Ducato,Birrificio Del Ducato La Luna Rossa,"Notes:I think that in the life of every brewer exists a particular moment that makes him proud and satisfied with his work: for me this time comes during the blend of La Luna Rossa. Maybe because it is the beer that it takes more time before leaving the brewery, or maybe for a certain analogy with the trade of enologist, it is always very emotional when myself and Luca (a solid presence at the brewery) find ourselves between sour splashes and leftover pieces of fruit that remind me the “visciole” (morello cherry) my grandfather used to eat while playng cards. It starts with an acidic base that has made at least 2 years of mixed fermentations (conducted mainly by lactic, acetic bacteria and brettanomyces) which have at least 6 months macerated cherries and sour cherries, blend with a small part of chimera and some young beer; the blend is put in numbered bottles indicating the year of the cuvée, which refined further 12 months before selling.La Luna Rossa is like a kriek on the basis flemish red, has an extraordinary complexity associated with a wonderful elegance, for lovers of the genre is definitely one of those beers that you find it difficult to forget.- GiovanniIn the glass, to the nose and in the mouth …Born from the blend about different beers, some of them aged in barrels until 2 years with the addition morello and marasca cherries. Intense amber colour with ruby reflections, extraordinary aromatic complexity: fruity aromas (marasca and morello cherries in the first place), accompanied by subtle ethereal notes and sublime acetic hints and lactic acid, as well as shades of oxidized malts.

Black Chocolate Stout,Stout - Russian Imperial,Brooklyn Brewery,Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout,"Notes:This is the famous Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. In the 18th century, Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, ordered a stout to be sent to her from England. This beer was brewed strong and hoppy to survive the sea voyage, and it arrived in perfect condition. Soon ""Russian Imperial Stout"" became the toast of the Russian aristocracy. Brewed since 1994, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. It achieves its dark chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six malts and three distinct mashes. Properly kept, it will improve in the bottle for many years. This stout is the toast of the winter season in many countries, and there is nothing better to enjoy with chocolate desserts, cheesecake, ice cream, fine cheeses and roaring fireplaces.Given this beer’s higher ABV and sturdy character, we think it’s a prime candidate for cellaring. Find a cool, dry spot away from light sources, and see how it changes in the years to come. You never quite know what will happen when you age a beer: perhaps the body will smooth out, notes of vanilla, oak, and tannins will come to the front, or hints of leather and soy sauce will make themselves known. No matter what, remember that beer is meant for drinking, so don’t keep it to yourself for too long.\t",10.0,50,90,12,107,34,45,82,7,0,6,30,10,111,4.110544,4.293829,4.165304,4.220883,4.032284,2447,Brooklyn,USA

However, for fans of the original Black Metal, or “O.G. Black Metal” as its known, we feel as though we need to borrow the famous line from Stone Brewing Co.‘s Arrogant Bastard Ale: “You probably won’t like it.” Like all our beer, the flavors and aromas of the current batch of Black Metal are very much fermentation derived and rely far less on copious amounts of malt and hops. This is what we like to drink. We like dry, balanced, drinkable, tart beers with some interesting yeast complexity. We feel we’ve achieved this with Black Metal, and hope others enjoy it as well.

So he picked the mailbox, and we weren’t about to argue with him. You can say what you want about him, but that Death sure has a big heart.

Therefore, the Heart of Gold beer aging in the barrel starts to absorb back some of the Devil’s Cut and hence the name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"". We took our Heart of Gold and aged it in a Knob Creek 9-year old barrel from our friends at The Wine and Cheese Place in October 2011.
